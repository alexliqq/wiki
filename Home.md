## FAQ
Question：If I want to register a platform, how many YOYO do I need for the cost?
> Currently, at least 11000 YOYO are needed. 10000 of them are the collateral for the platform, and 1000 of them are the fees for creating the platform.

Question：Through YOYOW-WeCenter, you can easily build your own Q&A website, and you can directly access the YOYOW network. Does YOYOW-WeCenter support self-issued tokens?
> Currently YOYOW-WeCenter only supports the issuance of YOYO, and does not support third-party token. However, this feature is already under development and is expected to be released in the near future.

Question：How to get YOYO rewards after the platform is integrated ?
> At present, the incentive rewards of the platform mainly come from three channels: 1) business cooperation with the YOYOW team, and the team will reward YOYO 2) issuing your own token, rewarding the users 3) buying YOYO by yourself.
> 
> At present, YOYOW mainnet will not automatically assign YOYO, and this feature may be open sometime in the future. Stay tuned!

Question: In the future, if the platform gets the YOYO rewards, what is the distribution ratio? What is the percentage of the platform side / user each?
